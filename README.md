# Model Fine-Tuning on 7b Model with LoRa Integration

## Objective: 
This project focuses on fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained model with at least 7 billion parameters, incorporating LoRa (Long Range) technology for efficient and effective adaptation. This README details the process and outcomes of fine-tuning the Falcon-7b Large Language Model (LLM) using the QLoRA technique, focused on creating a mental health chatbot.
